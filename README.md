Sketching with Hardware - Green House:

For this project our team built a sclaed down model of a house, simulating the use of renewable enrgies.
This is the webapp which monitors the output of the solar panel, wind turbine, and hydro.
The core of the house model is a esp32 running Arduino C++ code, the data is transferred to Firebase Realtime Database via bluetooth.
