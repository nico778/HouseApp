**Sketching with Hardware â€“ Green House:**

For this project, our team developed a scaled-down model of a house designed to simulate the utilization of renewable energy sources. This web application monitors the output generated by the solar panel, wind turbine, and hydroelectric unit. At the heart of the system is an ESP32 microcontroller running Arduino C++ code. It collects real-time data and transmits it via Bluetooth to a Firebase Realtime Database, enabling seamless data monitoring and analysis.
